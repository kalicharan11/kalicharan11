Aim: Use the potentiometer to change the red LED intensity from 0 to maximum in 256 steps.
Codes:
//changing brightness of LED using potentiometer

#define LED_PIN 11
#define POTENTIOMETER_PIN A1
void setup()
{
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);
}
void loop()
{
  int potentiometerValue = analogRead(POTENTIOMETER_PIN);
  int brightness = potentiometerValue/4 ;
  analogWrite(LED_PIN, brightness);
}
Precautions and sources of error:
•	Ensure that the circuit connections are proper.
•	Different devices should be attached to the respective pins of Uno.
•	Codes should be written in C++ correctly.
•	Ground (GND) must be connected.
