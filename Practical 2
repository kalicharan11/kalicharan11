Aim: Hello LED- Flash LED at a rate such that the LED appears 
always on. Estimate the onset of the rate when the LED appears to stay 
on.
Codes:
// C++ code
//
const int ledPin = 13;
void setup() {
 pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
 digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // Turn on LED
 delay(10); // Wait for 10 milliseconds
 digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // Turn off LED
 delay(10); // Wait for 10 milliseconds
}
Precautions and sources of error:
• Ensure that the circuit connections are proper.
• Different devices should be attached to the respective pins of Uno.
• Codes should be written in C++ correctly.
• Ground (GND) must be connected.
